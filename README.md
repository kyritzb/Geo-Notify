# Geo-Notify

My first IOS app built in xCode. It allows the user to search for a destination on the map. 
When the user arrives to the location the phone will send a notification and ring. This app 
will be useful for people who use public transport and want to sleep, but want to wake up 
when they are near their destination. The app also has a calculator.
